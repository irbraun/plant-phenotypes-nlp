    "### Text mining analysis and network analysis of the Oellrich, Walls et al., (2015) dataset\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to evaluate the phenotype similarity network based off of hand-curated EQ statement annotations with GO, PO, PATO, and ChEBI terms with regards to how well this network clusters phenotypes related to genes which have known protein-protein interactions, have biochemical pathways in common, or are involved in common phenotype groupings. These properties of this network are compared against these properties in networks constructed from the same data but using natural language processing and machine learning approaches to evaluating text similarity, as well as combinations of these approaches using higher level models. Output from this notebook is saved with naming conventions according to when the notebook was run, and all outputs are saved as images or tables in CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to answer the question of how networks genereated using phenotypic-text similarity based approaches through either embedding, vocabulary presence, or ontology annotation compare to or relate to networks that specify known protein-protein interactions. The hypothesis that these networks are potentially related is based on the idea that if two proteins interact, they are likely to be acting in a common pathway with a common biological function. If the phenotypic outcome of this pathway is observable and documented, then similarites between text describing the mutant phenotype for these genes may coincide with direct protein-protein interactions. The different sections in this notebook correspond to different ways of determining if the graphs based on similarity between text descriptions, encodings of text descriptions, or annotations derived from text descriptions at all correspond to known protein-protein interactions in this dataset. The knowledge source about the protein-protein interactions for genes in this dataset is the STRING database. The available entries in the whole dataset are subset to include only the genes that correspond to proteins that are atleast mentioned in the STRING database. This ways if a protein-protein interaction is not specified between two of the remaining genes, it is not because no interactions at all are documented either of those genes. The following cells focus on setting up a dataframe which specifies edge lists specific to each similarity method, and also a protein-protein interaction score for the genes which correspond to those two given nodes in the graphs."

    "This section defines some constants which are used for creating a uniquely named directory to contain all the outputs from running this instance of this notebook. The naming scheme is based on the time that the notebook is run. The other constants are used for specifying information in the output table about what the topic was for this notebook when it was run, such as looking at KEGG biochemical pathways or STRING protein-protein interaction data some other type of gene function grouping or hierarchy. These values are arbitrary and are just for keeping better notes about what the output of the notebook corresponds to. All the input and output file paths for loading datasets or models are also contained within this cell, so that if anything is moved the directories and file names should only have to be changed at this point and nowhere else further into the notebook. If additional files are added to the notebook cells they should be put here as well."

    "This section uses the text descriptions, preprocessed text descriptions, or ontology term annotations created or read in the previous sections to generate a vector representation for each gene and build a pairwise distance matrix for the whole dataset. Each method specified is a unique combination of a method of vectorization (bag-of-words, n-grams, document embedding model, etc) and distance metric (Euclidean, Jaccard, etc) applied to those vectors in constructing the pairwise matrix. The method of vectorization here is equivalent to feature selection, so the task is to figure out which type of vectors will encode features that are useful (n-grams, full words, only words from a certain vocabulary, etc)."

    "This is a way of statistically seeing if for some value k, the graph ranks more edges from some particular gene to any other gene that it has a true protein-protein interaction with higher or equal to rank k, than we would expect due to random chance. This way of looking at the problem helps to be less ambiguous than the previous methods, because it gets at the core of how this would actually be used. In other words, we don't really care how much true information we're missing as long as we're still able to pick up some new useful information by building these networks, so even though we could be missing a lot, what's going on at the very top of the results? These results should be comparable to very strictly thresholding the network and saying that the remaining edges are our guesses at interactions. This is comparable to just looking at the far left-hand side of the precision recall curves, but just quantifies it slightly differently."

    "### Can machine learning approaches learn relationships between concepts that are in ontologies?\n",
    "If the neural network document encoding models (Doc2Vec) are being successfully trained, then they should be able to recapture some of the domain-specific information that is written into relationships present in biological ontologies. Specifically, two concepts which have a parent-child relationship in PATO or PO can be considered to be highly similar in this context. We compare the distances between the labels for these pairs of terms as inferred by both the general Doc2Vec model trained on the English Wikipedia corpus, as well as our own models trained specifically on abstracts from PubMed that are specific to plant phenotypes. Here we generate figures to compare the results for a specific set of handpicked phrase or term pairs, as well as a second figure over all pairs parsed from the hierarchies in each ontology to check whether the result generalizes to the ontologies as a whole."

    "### Can we use this dataset to identify sentences from abstracts that contain phenotypic information?\n",
    "The question we want to answer is whether or not these machine learning approaches in combination with the gathered dataset of phenotypic descriptions provides a valuable method for identifying which sentences in abstracts are likely to contain to information related to phenotyping, as this approach could be valuable in a curation pipeline. We will use a partially hands on approach, only evaluating the predicted matches rather than creating a full dataset of annotated abstracts. This means that the result will have to be evaluated as quantifying how many of the return sentences are primarily about a phenotype, partially about a phenotype, or not about a phenotype (three different categories), we cannot actually get an F1 score for this approach because we will not know how many were missed or available as positives in the dataset from which the sentences were drawn. Types of classes could be:\n",
    "1. Specifically mentioning a phenotype (e.g. \"*Plants treated with chemical X exhibited phenotype Y*.\")\n",
    "2. Only generally discussing phenotypes as a topic (e.g. \"*We organized a dataset of Z phenotypes from Arabidopsis thaliana studies*.\")\n",
    "3. Not talking about phenotypes (e.g. \"*Arabidopsis thaliana is one of the most widely studied plant species.*\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the false positives for this analysis likely include sentences where phenotypes are specifically mentioned, but not in the context of observing those phenotypes in a particular plant, which is what we are interested in here because those are the type of descriptions that should go in a database or dataset or something. This should be taken into account when evaluating the scores, and further researcher for distinguishing between these types of descriptions should be done."
