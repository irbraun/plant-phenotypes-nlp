    "### Phenotypic Text Data (oellrich_walls_dataset_irb_cleaned.txt)\n",
    "This data contains the phenotype descriptions for dominant mutants of genes across six different plant species. The data is read in from a cleaned version that removed some small delimiter errors from the original dataset that is available as a supplemental file from that publication. The data itself is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several columns that contain information about gene names and accessions. We need to know what type of information is in each in order to know which should be retained in the dataset we are preparing. We are interested in both gene names that should map to a specific accession (like cyp716A12 or Medtr3g021350) as well as gene names that are enzyme descriptions (like Ubiquitin-Specific Protease) that could map to more than one gene in a particular species. Each type of information is valuable, but needs to be differentiated so that when comparing whether two rows are specifying the same gene, this is not confused with specifying two different genes that have the same function. In the case of this dataset, the gene symbol and gene identifier columns contain strings that we want to consider to be unique to a particular gene for a particular species, meaning that we can use those strings to look for these gene objects in other resources such as databases of pathway membership. The strings in the gene name column could be unique (narrow sheath1), but they can also be generic descriptions of enzymes (Ubiquitin-Specific Protease). For this reason, this column is not used in downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset includes both full phenotype descriptions in one field, and atomized statements (which are phene descriptions) in another field. Either or both of these can be used as a source of text annotations on which to calculate similarity between phenotypes, phenes, or assess a hypothesized connected between genes in a network. We will look at quantity and properties of each of these categerogies of descriptions available and save the restructured datasets separately for each type.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section creates a set of columns that have standardized names and include data in a standardized format that other functions within the package expect. The species column contains strings which are KEGG abbreviations for particular species. The gene names column contains any strings we want to consider to be uniquely mapped to some particular gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "When saving the dataset using the phenotype descriptions as the text description column, there will be duplicates with respect to the combination of that column and the gene names column. This is because for each phenotype description there can be one or more atomized statement that it is comprised of. However, merging these rows requires also merging the ontology term annotations that each was annotated with, and this requires logic that is applied later. At this step we're only concerned with getting the right information in the right columns, and any datset with that correct can be merged later."
