    "## Reading in data available through Oryzabase (Integrated Rice Science Database)\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to read in and do a preliminary analysis of the data related to text descriptions and ontology term annotations that are available through Oryzabase. The data needs to be organized and also restructured into a standard format that will allow it to be easily combined with datasets from other resources. This notebook takes the following input files that were obtained from OryzaBase and produces a set of files that have standard columns, including the species name, gene names, gene synonyms, text descriptions, and ontology term annotations. The gene names column includes unique gene accessions, names, symbols, or identifiers. The gene synonyms column is included for strings that are not necessary unique identifiers for a particular gene but still refer to that gene or describe its function.\n",

    "There are several columns that contain information about gene names and accessions. We need to know what type of information is in each in order to know which should be retained or parsed to form the desired cleaned dataset. We are interested in both gene names that should map to a specific accession (like cms-54257) as well as gene names that are enzyme descriptions (like Ubiquitin-Specific Protease) that could map to more than one gene in a particular species. Each type of information is valuable, but needs to be differentiated so that when comparing whether two rows are specifying the same gene, this is not confused with specifying two different genes that have the same function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gene symbols in this dataset are typically surrounded by square brackets but not always. If a second symbol for that same gene is mentioned in the same column, the second symbol might be enclosed in parentheses. The synonynms for the gene symbols are similarly sometimes enclosed in square brackets, and are typically separated by commas in cases where more than one are mentioned in this column. Also note that an underscore is being used to represent missing data, so this has to handled so that that character is not treated as a gene name that appears many times."
