We need to know what type of information is in each in order to know which should be retained or parsed to form the desired cleaned dataset. We are interested in both gene names that should map to a specific accession (like cms-54257) as well as gene names that are enzyme descriptions (like Ubiquitin-Specific Protease) that could map to more than one gene in a particular species. Each type of information is valuable, but needs to be differentiated so that when comparing whether two rows are specifying the same gene, this is not confused with specifying two different genes that have the same function."
