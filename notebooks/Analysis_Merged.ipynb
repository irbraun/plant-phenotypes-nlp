    "### Introduction: Text Mining Analysis of Phenotype Descriptions in Plants\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to evaluate what can be learned from a natural language processing approach to analyzing free-text descriptions of phenotype descriptions of plants. The approach is to generate pairwise distances matrices between a set of plant phenotype descriptions across different species, sourced from academic papers and online model organism databases. These pairwise distance matrices can be constructed using any vectorization method that can be applied to natural language. In this notebook, we specifically evaluate the use of n-gram and bag-of-words techniques, word and document embedding using Word2Vec and Doc2Vec, context-dependent word-embeddings using BERT and BioBERT, and ontology term annotations with automated annotation tools such as NOBLE Coder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading, manipulation, and filtering of the dataset of phenotype descriptions associated with genes across different plant species is largely handled through a Python package created for this purpose called OATS (Ontology Annotation and Text Similarity) which is available [here](https://github.com/irbraun/oats). Preprocessing of the descriptions, mapping the dataset to additional resources such as protein-protein interaction databases and biochemical pathway databases are handled in this notebook using that package as well. In the evaluation of each of these natural language processing approaches to analyzing this dataset of descriptions, we compare performance against a dataset generated through manual annotation of a similar dataset in Oellrich Walls et al. (2015) and against manual annotations with experimentally determined terms from the Gene Ontology (PO) and the Plant Ontology (PO).\n",

The naming scheme is based on the time that the notebook is run. The other constants are used for specifying information in the output table about what the topic was for this notebook when it was run, such as looking at KEGG biochemical pathways or STRING protein-protein interaction data some other type of gene function grouping or hierarchy. These values are arbitrary and are just for keeping better notes about what the output of the notebook corresponds to. All the input and output file paths for loading datasets or models are also contained within this cell, so that if anything is moved the directories and file names should only have to be changed at this point and nowhere else further into the notebook. If additional files are added to the notebook cells they should be put here as well."

In this case we want to only retain genes that are mentioned atleast one time in the STRING database for a given species. If a gene is not mentioned at all in STRING, there is no information available for whether or not it interacts with any other proteins in the dataset so choose to not include it in the analysis. Only genes that have atleast one true positive are included because these are the only ones for which the missing information (negatives) is meaningful. This should be run instead of the subsequent cell, or the other way around, based on whether or not protein-protein interactions is the prediction goal for the current analysis."

In this case we want to only retain genes that are mapped to atleast one pathway in whatever the source of pathway membership we are using is (KEGG, Plant Metabolic Network, etc). This is because for these genes, it will be impossible to correctly predict their pathway membership, and we have no evidence that they belong or do not belong in certain pathways so they can not be identified as being true or false negatives in any case. This should not actually be necessary if the dataset used to start the notebook analysis has already be subset for just the genes that either have pathway information of phenotype classification information, this should just be used to double check that the numbers make sense."

    "### Word2Vec and Doc2Vec\n",
    "Word2Vec is a word embedding technique using a neural network trained on a so-called *false task*, namely either predicting a missing word from within a sequence of context words drawn from a sentence or phrase, or predicting which contexts words surround some given input word drawn from a sentence or phrase. Each of these tasks are supervised (the correct answer is fixed and known), but can be generated from unlabelled text data such as a collection of books or wikipedia articles, meaning that even though the task itself is supervised the training data can be generated automatically, enabling the creation of enormous training sets. The internal representation for particular words learned during the training process contain semantically informative features related to that given word, and can therefore be used as embeddings used downstream for tasks such as finding similarity between words or as input into additional models. Doc2Vec is an extension of this technique that determines vector embeddings for entire documents (strings containing multiple words, could be sentences, paragraphs, or documents).\n",

    "BERT ('Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers') is another neueral network-based model trained on two different false tasks, namely predicting the subsequent sentence given some input sentence, or predicting the identity of a set of words masked from an input sentence. Like Word2Vec, this architecture can be used to generate vector embeddings for a particular input word by extracting values from a subset of the encoder layers that correspond to that input word. Practically, a major difference is that because the input word is input in the context of its surrounding sentence, the embedding reflects the meaning of a particular word in a particular context (such as the difference in the meaning of *root* in the phrases *plant root* and *root of the problem*. BioBERT refers to a set of BERT models which have been finetuned on the PubMed and PMC corpora. See the list of relevant links for the publications and pages associated with these models.\n",

    "The preprocessing methods applied to the phenotype descriptions are a choice which impacts the subsequent vectorization and similarity methods which construct the pairwise distance matrix from each of these descriptions. The preprocessing methods that make sense are also highly dependent on the vectorization method or embedding method that is to be applied. For example, stemming (which is part of the full proprocessing done below using the Gensim preprocessing function) is useful for the n-grams and bag-of-words methods but not for the document embeddings methods which need each token to be in the vocabulary that was constructed and used when the model was trained. For this reason, embedding methods with pretrained models where the vocabulary is fixed should have a lighter degree of preprocessing not involving stemming or lemmatization but should involve things like removal of non-alphanumerics and normalizing case.

    "### Running all of the methods to generate distance matrices\n",
    "Notes- Instead of passing in similarity function like cosine distance that will get evaluated for every possible i,j pair of vetors that are created (this is very big when splitting by phenes), don't use a specific similarity function, but instead let the object use a KNN classifier. pass in some limit for k like 100. then the object uses some more efficient (not brute force) algorithm to set the similarity of some vector v to its 100 nearest neighbors as those 100 probabilities, and sets everything else to 0. This would need to be implemented as a matching but separate function from the get_square_matrix_from_vectors thing. And then this would need to be noted in the similarity function that was used for these in the big table of methods. This won't work because the faster (not brute force algorithms) are not for sparse vectors like n-grams, and the non-sparse embeddings aren't really the problem here because those vectors are relatively much short, even when concatenating BERT encoder layers thats only up to around length of ~1000."

    "The purpose of this section is to visualize kernel estimates for the distributions of distance or similarity scores generated by each of the methods tested for measuring semantic similarity or generating vector representations of the phenotype descriptions. Ideally, better methods should show better separation betwene the distributions for distance values between two genes involved in a common specified group or two genes that are not. Additionally, a statistical test is used to check whether these two distributions are significantly different from each other or not, although this is a less informative measure than the other tests used in subsequent sections, because it does not address how useful these differences in the distributions actually are for making predictions about group membership."

    "This is a way of statistically seeing if for some value k, the graph ranks more edges from some particular gene to any other gene that it has a true protein-protein interaction with higher or equal to rank k, than we would expect due to random chance. This way of looking at the problem helps to be less ambiguous than the previous methods, because it gets at the core of how this would actually be used. In other words, we don't really care how much true information we're missing as long as we're still able to pick up some new useful information by building these networks, so even though we could be missing a lot, what's going on at the very top of the results? These results should be comparable to very strictly thresholding the network and saying that the remaining edges are our guesses at interactions. This is comparable to just looking at the far left-hand side of the precision recall curves, but just quantifies it slightly differently."

    "This section looks at how well the biochemical pathways that a particular gene is a member of can be predicted based on the similarity between the vector representation of the phenotype descriptions for that gene and the average vector for all the vector representations of phenotypes asociated with genes that belong to that particular pathway. In calculating the average vector for a given biochemical pathway, the vector corresponding to the gene that is currently being classified is not accounted for, to avoid overestimating the performance by including information about the ground truth during classification. This leads to missing information in the case of biochemical pathways that have only one member. This can be accounted for by only limiting the overall dataset to only include genes that belong to pathways that have atleast two genes mapped to them, and only including those pathways, or by removing the missing values before calculating the performance metrics below."

    "### Predicting biochemical pathway membership based on mean similarity values\n",
    "This section looks at how well the biochemical pathways that a particular gene is a member of can be predicted based on the average similarity between the vector representationt of the phenotype descriptions for that gene and each of the vector representations for other phenotypes associated with genes that belong to that particular pathway. In calculating the average similarity to other genes from a given biochemical pathway, the gene that is currently being classified is not accounted for, to avoid overestimating the performance by including information about the ground truth during classification. This leads to missing information in the case of biochemical pathways that have only one member. This can be accounted for by only limiting the overall dataset to only include genes that belong to pathways that have atleast two genes mapped to them, and only including those pathways, or by removing the missing values before calculating the performance metrics below."

    "This section looks at how well the group(s) or biochemical pathway(s) that a particular gene belongs to can be predicted based on a KNN classifier generated using every other gene. For this section, only the groups or pathways which contain more than one gene, and the genes mapped to those groups or pathways, are of interest. This is because for other genes, if we consider them then it will be true that that gene belongs to that group in the target vector, but the KNN classifier could never predict this because when that gene is held out, nothing could provide a vote for that group, because there are zero genes available to be members of the K nearest neighbors."

    "### Approach 1: Topic modeling based on n-grams with a reduced vocabulary\n",
    "Topic modelling learns a set of word probability distributions from the dataset of text descriptions, which represent distinct topics which are present in the dataset. Each text description can then be represented as a discrete probability distribution over the learned topics based on the probability that a given piece of text belongs to each particular topics. This is a form of data reduction because a high dimensionsal bag-of-words can be represented as a vector of *k* probabilities where *k* is the number of topics. The main advantages of topic modelling over clustering is that topic modelling provides soft classifications that can be additionally interpreted, rather than hard classifications into a single cluster. Topic models are also explainable, because the word probability distributions for that topic can be used to determine which words are most representative of any given topic. One problem with topic modelling is that is uses the n-grams embeddings to semantic similarity between different words is not accounted for. To help alleviate this, this section uses implementations of some existing algorithms to compress the vocabulary as a preprocessing step based on word distance matrices generated using word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic models define topics present in a dataset of texts as word or n-gram probability distributions. These models represent each instance of text then as being composed of or generated as as mixture of these topics. The vector for each text that indicates which fraction of that text is generated by a each topic is of length *n* where *n* is the number of topics, and can be used as a reduced dimensionality of the text, with a much smaller vector length than the n-grams embedding itself. Therefore we can build a topic model of the data with 100 topics for example in order to then represent each description in the dataset as a a vector of length 100. This section constructs topic models from the n-gram representations of the dataset and selects different values for the number of topics in order to find a value that works well during the grid search over the training dataset."

Clustering into a fixed number of clusters allows for clustering into a similar number of groups as a present in some existing grouping of the data, such as phenotype categories or biochemical pathways, and then determining if the clusters obtained are at all similar to the groupings that already exist. Agglomerative clustering is used here in order to use an arbitrary predefined distance matrix, in this case the matrix being used is the mean distance percentiles from each of the different approaches."

    "This section produces a table of values that provides a score for the a particular pair of a cluster found for this dataset of plant genes and a disease phenotype. Currently the value indicates the fraction of the plant genes in that cluster that have orthologs associated with that disease phenotype. This should be replaced or supplemented with a p-value for evaluating the significance of this value given the distribution of genes and their mappings to all of the disease phenotypes. All the rows from the input dataframe containing the PantherDB and OMIM information where the ID from this dataset is not known or the mapping to a phenotype was unsuccessful are removed at this step, fix this if the metric for evaluating cluster to phenotype phenolog mappings need this information."
