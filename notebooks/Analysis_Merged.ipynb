    "### Introduction: Text Mining Analysis of Phenotype Descriptions in Plants\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to evaluate what can be learned from a natural language processing approach to analyzing free-text descriptions of phenotype descriptions of plants. The approach is to generate pairwise distances matrices between a set of plant phenotype descriptions across different species, sourced from academic papers and online model organism databases. These pairwise distance matrices can be constructed using any vectorization method that can be applied to natural language. In this notebook, we specifically evaluate the use of n-gram and bag-of-words techniques, word and document embedding using Word2Vec and Doc2Vec, context-dependent word-embeddings using BERT and BioBERT, and ontology term annotations with automated annotation tools such as NOBLE Coder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading, manipulation, and filtering of the dataset of phenotype descriptions associated with genes across different plant species is largely handled through a Python package created for this purpose called OATS (Ontology Annotation and Text Similarity) which is available [here](https://github.com/irbraun/oats). Preprocessing of the descriptions, mapping the dataset to additional resources such as protein-protein interaction databases and biochemical pathway databases are handled in this notebook using that package as well. In the evaluation of each of these natural language processing approaches to analyzing this dataset of descriptions, we compare performance against a dataset generated through manual annotation of a similar dataset in Oellrich Walls et al. (2015) and against manual annotations with experimentally determined terms from the Gene Ontology (PO) and the Plant Ontology (PO).\n",

The naming scheme is based on the time that the notebook is run. The other constants are used for specifying information in the output table about what the topic was for this notebook when it was run, such as looking at KEGG biochemical pathways or STRING protein-protein interaction data some other type of gene function grouping or hierarchy. These values are arbitrary and are just for keeping better notes about what the output of the notebook corresponds to. All the input and output file paths for loading datasets or models are also contained within this cell, so that if anything is moved the directories and file names should only have to be changed at this point and nowhere else further into the notebook. If additional files are added to the notebook cells they should be put here as well."

In this case we want to only retain genes that are mentioned atleast one time in the STRING database for a given species. If a gene is not mentioned at all in STRING, there is no information available for whether or not it interacts with any other proteins in the dataset so choose to not include it in the analysis. Only genes that have atleast one true positive are included because these are the only ones for which the missing information (negatives) is meaningful.

In this case we want to only retain genes that are mapped to atleast one pathway in whatever the source of pathway membership we are using is (KEGG, Plant Metabolic Network, etc). This is because for these genes, it will be impossible to correctly predict their pathway membership, and we have no evidence that they belong or do not belong in certain pathways so they can not be identified as being true or false negatives in any case. This should not actually be necessary if the dataset used to start the notebook analysis has already be subset for just the genes that either have pathway information of phenotype classification information, this should just be used to double check that the numbers make sense."

    "### Word2Vec and Doc2Vec\n",
    "Word2Vec is a word embedding technique using a neural network trained on a so-called *false task*, namely either predicting a missing word from within a sequence of context words drawn from a sentence or phrase, or predicting which contexts words surround some given input word drawn from a sentence or phrase. Each of these tasks are supervised (the correct answer is fixed and known), but can be generated from unlabelled text data such as a collection of books or wikipedia articles, meaning that even though the task itself is supervised the training data can be generated automatically, enabling the creation of enormous training sets. The internal representation for particular words learned during the training process contain semantically informative features related to that given word, and can therefore be used as embeddings used downstream for tasks such as finding similarity between words or as input into additional models. Doc2Vec is an extension of this technique that determines vector embeddings for entire documents (strings containing multiple words, could be sentences, paragraphs, or documents).\n",

    "BERT ('Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers') is another neueral network-based model trained on two different false tasks, namely predicting the subsequent sentence given some input sentence, or predicting the identity of a set of words masked from an input sentence. Like Word2Vec, this architecture can be used to generate vector embeddings for a particular input word by extracting values from a subset of the encoder layers that correspond to that input word. Practically, a major difference is that because the input word is input in the context of its surrounding sentence, the embedding reflects the meaning of a particular word in a particular context (such as the difference in the meaning of *root* in the phrases *plant root* and *root of the problem*. BioBERT refers to a set of BERT models which have been finetuned on the PubMed and PMC corpora. See the list of relevant links for the publications and pages associated with these models.\n",

The preprocessing methods that make sense are also highly dependent on the vectorization method or embedding method that is to be applied. For example, stemming (which is part of the full proprocessing done below using the Gensim preprocessing function) is useful for the n-grams and bag-of-words methods but not for the document embeddings methods which need each token to be in the vocabulary that was constructed and used when the model was trained. For this reason, embedding methods with pretrained models where the vocabulary is fixed should have a lighter degree of preprocessing not involving stemming or lemmatization but should involve things like removal of non-alphanumerics and normalizing case.

These methods work by actually generating versions of these descriptions that have the word replacements present. The returned objects for these methods are the revised description dictionary, a dictionary mapping tokens in the full vocabulary to tokens in the reduced vocabulary, and a dictionary mapping tokens in the reduced vocabulary to a list of tokens in the full vocabulary."

    "Notes- Instead of passing in similarity function like cosine distance that will get evaluated for every possible i,j pair of vetors that are created (this is very big when splitting by phenes), don't use a specific similarity function, but instead let the object use a KNN classifier. pass in some limit for k like 100. then the object uses some more efficient (not brute force) algorithm to set the similarity of some vector v to its 100 nearest neighbors as those 100 probabilities, and sets everything else to 0. This would need to be implemented as a matching but separate function from the get_square_matrix_from_vectors thing. And then this would need to be noted in the similarity function that was used for these in the big table of methods. This won't work because the faster (not brute force algorithms) are not for sparse vectors like n-grams, and the non-sparse embeddings aren't really the problem here because those vectors are relatively much short, even when concatenating BERT encoder layers thats only up to around length of ~1000."

The information input to these models is the distance scores provided by each method in some set of all the methods used in this notebook. The purpose is to see whether or not a function of these similarity scores specifically trained to the task of predicting common groupings is better able to used the distance metric information to report a score for this task."

    "This is a way of statistically seeing if for some value k, the graph ranks more edges from some particular gene to any other gene that it has a true protein-protein interaction with higher or equal to rank k, than we would expect due to random chance. This way of looking at the problem helps to be less ambiguous than the previous methods, because it gets at the core of how this would actually be used. In other words, we don't really care how much true information we're missing as long as we're still able to pick up some new useful information by building these networks, so even though we could be missing a lot, what's going on at the very top of the results? These results should be comparable to very strictly thresholding the network and saying that the remaining edges are our guesses at interactions. This is comparable to just looking at the far left-hand side of the precision recall curves, but just quantifies it slightly differently."

    "### Approach 1: Topic modeling based on n-grams with a reduced vocabulary\n",
    "Topic modelling learns a set of word probability distributions from the dataset of text descriptions, which represent distinct topics which are present in the dataset. Each text description can then be represented as a discrete probability distribution over the learned topics based on the probability that a given piece of text belongs to each particular topics. This is a form of data reduction because a high dimensionsal bag-of-words can be represented as a vector of *k* probabilities where *k* is the number of topics. The main advantages of topic modelling over clustering is that topic modelling provides soft classifications that can be additionally interpreted, rather than hard classifications into a single cluster. Topic models are also explainable, because the word probability distributions for that topic can be used to determine which words are most representative of any given topic. One problem with topic modelling is that is uses the n-grams embeddings to semantic similarity between different words is not accounted for. To help alleviate this, this section uses implementations of some existing algorithms to compress the vocabulary as a preprocessing step based on word distance matrices generated using word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic models define topics present in a dataset of texts as word or n-gram probability distributions. These models represent each instance of text then as being composed of or generated as as mixture of these topics. The vector for each text that indicates which fraction of that text is generated by a each topic is of length *n* where *n* is the number of topics, and can be used as a reduced dimensionality of the text, with a much smaller vector length than the n-grams embedding itself. Therefore we can build a topic model of the data with 100 topics for example in order to then represent each description in the dataset as a a vector of length 100. This section constructs topic models from the n-gram representations of the dataset and selects different values for the number of topics in order to find a value that works well during the grid search over the training dataset."
