4	Arabidopsis	COP1	At2g32950	0.000	Trait requires sunlight for expression.	Dark-grown mutant seedlings are transferred to the light, a significant portion of the seedlings are unable to green and will bleach out and die.	1988

4	Arabidopsis	COP1	At2g32950	0.000	Trait requires sunlight for expression.	The mutant does not show additional hypocotyl elongation under far-red light-enriched conditions, whereas the wild-type seedlings display more than a twofold increase in hypocotyl elongation.	1988

44	Arabidopsis	PIL1	At2g46970	0.000	Trait requires sunlight for expression.	The mutant seedlings display a marked attenuation of the maximal promotion of elongation by transient low R/FR and an increase in the magnitude of the growth inhibition caused by transient low R/FR at subjective dawn.	47
