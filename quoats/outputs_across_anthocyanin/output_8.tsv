50	Arabidopsis	HYH	At3g17609	0.000	Light inducible colored aleurone.	The double-mutant seedlings contains &#8764.	2358
50	Arabidopsis	HYH	At3g17609	0.000	Light inducible colored aleurone.	80% anthocyanin accumulation compared with that of the hy5 mutation alone.	2358
50	Arabidopsis	HYH	At3g17609	0.000	Light inducible colored aleurone.	No significant difference in chlorophyll content was observed, but hyh seedlings accumulate slightly reduced levels of anthocyanin.	2358
50	Arabidopsis	HYH	At3g17609	0.000	Mottled kernel.	Early flowering.	2358
50	Arabidopsis	HYH	At3g17609	0.000	Mottled kernel.	Long hypocotyl under blue light.	2358
50	Arabidopsis	HYH	At3g17609	0.000	Mottled kernel.	Slightly pale green.	2358
50	Arabidopsis	HYH	At3g17609	0.000	Mottled kernel.	Indistinguishable from the respective cop1 mutants when grown in darkness.	2358
50	Arabidopsis	HYH	At3g17609	0.000	Mottled kernel.	No suppression of the light-dependent cop1 phenotype where seedlings bleach and die when transferred from darkness to light.	2358

50	Arabidopsis	HYH	At3g17609	0.000	Mottled kernel.	Suppression in a substantial number of seedlings of the light-dependent cop1 phenotype where seedlings bleach and die when transferred from darkness to light.	2358
50	Arabidopsis	HYH	At3g17609	0.000	Mottled kernel.	Blue-light-grown double-mutant seedlings have a longer hypocotyl than seedlings carrying the hyh or hy5 mutation alone.	2358
