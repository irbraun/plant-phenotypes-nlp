11	Arabidopsis	RPN12a	At1g64520	0.000	Mature seeds darker than wildtype.	Red hypocotyls and petioles due to anthocyanin accumulation.	1377
11	Arabidopsis	RPN12a	At1g64520	0.000	Mature seeds darker than wildtype.	The rpn12a-1 mutant produces both the WT RPN12a protein and a RPN12a(1-186):ARP(exon2):NPTII fusion protein.	1377
11	Arabidopsis	RPN12a	At1g64520	0.000	Mature seeds darker than wildtype.	The mutant form of the protein can coelute with subunits of the 26S proteasome from the regulatory and core particles and there is no increase in total steady state levels of ubiquitinated proteins in homozygous mutant seedlings.	1377
11	Arabidopsis	RPN12a	At1g64520	0.000	Mature seeds darker than wildtype.	This mutant has seedling growth defects, elevated anthocyanin levels, abnormal leaf root development, delayed skotomorphogenesis, altered cytokinin responses, and reduced auxin sensitivity in their roots.	1377
11	Arabidopsis	RPN12a	At1g64520	0.000	Mature seeds darker than wildtype.	The rpn12a-1 mutant has defects in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis via the 26S proteasome, rendering it more sensitive to misfolded proteins that are degraded in a 26S-proteasome / Ub-dependent manner.	1377
11	Arabidopsis	RPN12a	At1g64520	0.000	Mature seeds darker than wildtype.	However, it has increased levels of the 20S core particle of the proteasome, and exhibits reduced sensitivity to oxidative stress, presumably since oxidatively damaged proteins can be degraded in a 20S proteasome-dependent, but 26S proteasome /Ub-independent manner.	1377
