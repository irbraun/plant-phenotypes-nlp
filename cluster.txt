Copying to repositories to HPC clusters

- Modify and use the sync.sh script.




Running analysis scripts on the HPC clusters

- Check module names and versions in the submit scripts, the two required ones are Conda and Java.
- Check that the Conda environment is built with the most recent environment files, and should be ~/.conda.
- Make a symbolic link from ~/.conda to the working directory because the size of those files will be too large for the home directory.
- Check that the NOBLE Coder terminologies are present in the ~/.noble/terminologies/ folder, which is not copied over by sync.sh script.
- Make a symbolic link from ~/.noble/terminologies/ to the working directory if needed because the terminology files are too large.
- Check the runtime on the submit scripts.
- Check that the notebooks can been converted to python scripts.
